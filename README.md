# skin-previewer
convert minecraft skin to a version usable for minetest wardrobe mod

A simple command line tool to take a skin and make it a 64x32 skin and then make a 16x32 front facing preview.

This preview is not "True" - as we use the right arm for both left and right and just flip.

BUT it's enough for what we need.
